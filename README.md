# clojurejs

A simplistic Clojure interpreter written in JavaScript, for running Clojure in the browser or in node.

This is only an experiment in parsing and evaluating a LISP in JavaScript, i.e. it is not intended to be complete in any way.

The current goal of the project is to implement the features listed in the [Clojure Cheat Sheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) that makes sense running in a browser.

Head over to [the demo page](http://gnab.github.com/clojurejs) to check it out.

### Getting Started

Only a few, simple steps is required:

    git clone git://github.com/gnab/clojurejs.git
    make

Also, you need node (and npm) installed on your system.
